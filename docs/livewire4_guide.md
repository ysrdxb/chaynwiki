Livewire v4 introduces several improvements and optimizations while maintaining backward compatibility wherever possible. This guide will help you upgrade from Livewire v3 to v4.

Smooth upgrade path
Most applications can upgrade to v4 with minimal changes. The breaking changes are primarily configuration updates and method signature changes that only affect advanced usage.

Want to save time? You can use Laravel Shift to help automate your application upgrades.

#Installation
Update your composer.json to require Livewire v4:

composer require livewire/livewire:^4.0
After updating, clear your application's cache:

php artisan optimize:clear

#High-impact changes
These changes are most likely to affect your application and should be reviewed carefully.

#Config file updates
Several configuration keys have been renamed, reorganized, or have new defaults. Update your config/livewire.php file:

For reference, you can view the complete v4 config file on GitHub: livewire.php →

#Renamed configuration keys
Layout configuration:

// Before (v3)
'layout' => 'components.layouts.app',
 
// After (v4)
'component_layout' => 'layouts::app',
The layout now uses the layouts:: namespace by default, pointing to resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php.

Placeholder configuration:

// Before (v3)
'lazy_placeholder' => 'livewire.placeholder',
 
// After (v4)
'component_placeholder' => 'livewire.placeholder',
#Changed defaults
Smart wire:key behavior:

// Now defaults to true (was false in v3)
'smart_wire_keys' => true,
This helps prevent wire:key issues on deeply nested components. Note: You still need to add wire:key manually in loops—this setting doesn't eliminate that requirement.

#New configuration options
Component locations:

'component_locations' => [
    resource_path('views/components'),
    resource_path('views/livewire'),
],
Defines where Livewire looks for single-file and multi-file (view-based) components.

Component namespaces:

'component_namespaces' => [
    'layouts' => resource_path('views/layouts'),
    'pages' => resource_path('views/pages'),
],
Creates custom namespaces for organizing view-based components (e.g., <livewire:pages::dashboard />).

Make command defaults:

'make_command' => [
    'type' => 'sfc',  // Options: 'sfc', 'mfc', or 'class'
    'emoji' => true,   // Whether to use ⚡ emoji prefix
],
Configure default component format and emoji usage. Set type to 'class' to match v3 behavior.

CSP-safe mode:

'csp_safe' => false,
Enable Content Security Policy mode to avoid unsafe-eval violations. When enabled, Livewire uses the Alpine CSP build. Note: This mode restricts complex JavaScript expressions in directives like wire:click="addToCart($event.detail.productId)" or global references like window.location.

#Routing changes
For full-page components, the recommended routing approach has changed:

// Before (v3) - still works but not recommended
Route::get('/dashboard', Dashboard::class);
 
// After (v4) - recommended for all component types
Route::livewire('/dashboard', Dashboard::class);
 
// For view-based components, you can use the component name
Route::livewire('/dashboard', 'pages::dashboard');
Using Route::livewire() is now the preferred method and is required for single-file and multi-file components to work correctly as full-page components.

#wire:model now ignores child events by default
In v3, wire:model would respond to input/change events that bubbled up from child elements. This caused unexpected behavior when using wire:model on container elements (like modals or accordions) that contained form inputs—clearing an input inside would bubble up and potentially close the modal.

In v4, wire:model now only listens for events originating directly on the element itself (equivalent to the .self modifier behavior).

If you have code that relies on capturing events from child elements, add the .deep modifier:

<!-- Before (v3) - listened to child events by default -->
<div wire:model="value">
    <input type="text">
</div>
 
<!-- After (v4) - add .deep to restore old behavior -->
<div wire:model.deep="value">
    <input type="text">
</div>
Most apps won't need changes
This change primarily affects non-standard uses of wire:model on container elements. Standard form input bindings (inputs, selects, textareas) are unaffected.

#Use wire:navigate:scroll
When using wire:scroll to preserve scroll in a scrollable container across wire:navigate requests in v3, you will need to instead use wire:navigate:scroll in v4:

@persist('sidebar')
    <div class="overflow-y-scroll" wire:scroll> <!--  -->
    <div class="overflow-y-scroll" wire:navigate:scroll> <!--  -->
        <!-- ... -->
    </div>
@endpersist
#Component tags must be closed
In v3, Livewire component tags would render even without being properly closed. In v4, with the addition of slot support, component tags must be properly closed—otherwise Livewire interprets subsequent content as slot content and the component won't render:

<!-- Before (v3) - unclosed tag -->
<livewire:component-name>
 
<!-- After (v4) - Self-closing tag -->
<livewire:component-name />

#Medium-impact changes
These changes may affect certain parts of your application depending on which features you use.

#wire:transition now uses View Transitions API
In v3, wire:transition was a wrapper around Alpine's x-transition directive, supporting modifiers like .opacity, .scale, .duration.200ms, and .origin.top.

In v4, wire:transition uses the browser's native View Transitions API instead. Basic usage still works—elements will fade in and out smoothly—but all modifiers have been removed.

<!-- This still works in v4 -->
<div wire:transition>...</div>
 
<!-- These modifiers are no longer supported -->
<div wire:transition.opacity>...</div> 
<div wire:transition.scale.origin.top>...</div> 
<div wire:transition.duration.500ms>...</div>

#Performance improvements
Livewire v4 includes significant performance improvements to the request handling system:

Non-blocking polling: wire:poll no longer blocks other requests or is blocked by them
Parallel live updates: wire:model.live requests now run in parallel, allowing faster typing and quicker results
These improvements happen automatically—no changes needed to your code.

#Update hooks consolidate array/object changes
When replacing an entire array or object from the frontend (e.g., $wire.items = ['new', 'values']), Livewire now sends a single consolidated update instead of granular updates for each index.

Before: Setting $wire.items = ['a', 'b'] on an array of 4 items would fire updatingItems/updatedItems hooks multiple times—once for each index change plus __rm__ removals.

After: The same operation fires the hooks once with the full new array value, matching v2 behavior.

If your code relies on individual index hooks firing when replacing entire arrays, you may need to adjust. Single-item changes (like wire:model="items.0") still fire granular hooks as expected.

#Method signature changes
If you're extending Livewire's core functionality or using these methods directly, note these signature changes:

Streaming:

The stream() method parameter order has changed:

// Before (v3)
$this->stream(to: '#container', content: 'Hello', replace: true);
 
// After (v4)
$this->stream(content: 'Hello', replace: true, el: '#container');
If you're using named parameters (as shown above), note that to: has been renamed to el:. If you're using positional parameters, you'll need to update to the following:

// Before (v3) - positional parameters
$this->stream('#container', 'Hello');
 
// After (v4) - positional/named parameters
$this->stream('Hello', el: '#container');

Component mounting (internal):

If you're extending LivewireManager or calling the mount() method directly:

// Before (v3)
public function mount($name, $params = [], $key = null)
 
// After (v4)
public function mount($name, $params = [], $key = null, $slots = [])
This change adds support for passing slots when mounting components and generally won't affect most applications.

#Low-impact changes
These changes only affect applications using advanced features or customization.

#JavaScript deprecations
#Deprecated: $wire.$js() method
The $wire.$js() method for defining JavaScript actions has been deprecated:

// Deprecated (v3)
$wire.$js('bookmark', () => {
    // Toggle bookmark...
})
 
// New (v4)
$wire.$js.bookmark = () => {
    // Toggle bookmark...
}
The new syntax is cleaner and more intuitive.

#Deprecated: $js without prefix
The use of $js in scripts without $wire.$js or this.$js prefix has been deprecated:

// Deprecated (v3)
$js('bookmark', () => {
    // Toggle bookmark...
})
 
// New (v4)
$wire.$js.bookmark = () => {
    // Toggle bookmark...
}
// Or
this.$js.bookmark = () => {
    // Toggle bookmark...
}
Old syntax still works
Both $wire.$js('bookmark', ...) and $js('bookmark', ...) will continue to work in v4 for backward compatibility, but you should migrate to the new syntax when convenient.

#Deprecated: commit and request hooks
The commit and request hooks have been deprecated in favor of a new interceptor system that provides more granular control and better performance.

Old hooks still work
The deprecated hooks will continue to work in v4 for backward compatibility, but you should migrate to the new system when convenient.

#Migrating from commit hook
The old commit hook:

// OLD - Deprecated
Livewire.hook('commit', ({ component, commit, respond, succeed, fail }) => {
    respond(() => {
        // Runs after response received but before processing
    })
 
    succeed(({ snapshot, effects }) => {
        // Runs after successful response
    })
 
    fail(() => {
        // Runs if request failed
    })
})
Should be replaced with the new interceptMessage:

// NEW - Recommended
Livewire.interceptMessage(({ component, message, onFinish, onSuccess, onError, onFailure }) => {
    onFinish(() => {
        // Equivalent to respond()
    })
 
    onSuccess(({ payload }) => {
        // Equivalent to succeed()
        // Access snapshot via payload.snapshot
        // Access effects via payload.effects
    })
 
    onError(() => {
        // Equivalent to fail() for server errors
    })
 
    onFailure(() => {
        // Equivalent to fail() for network errors
    })
})
#Migrating from request hook
The old request hook:

// OLD - Deprecated
Livewire.hook('request', ({ url, options, payload, respond, succeed, fail }) => {
    respond(({ status, response }) => {
        // Runs when response received
    })
 
    succeed(({ status, json }) => {
        // Runs on successful response
    })
 
    fail(({ status, content, preventDefault }) => {
        // Runs on failed response
    })
})
Should be replaced with the new interceptRequest:

// NEW - Recommended
Livewire.interceptRequest(({ request, onResponse, onSuccess, onError, onFailure }) => {
    // Access url via request.uri
    // Access options via request.options
    // Access payload via request.payload
 
    onResponse(({ response }) => {
        // Equivalent to respond()
        // Access status via response.status
    })
 
    onSuccess(({ response, responseJson }) => {
        // Equivalent to succeed()
        // Access status via response.status
        // Access json via responseJson
    })
 
    onError(({ response, responseBody, preventDefault }) => {
        // Equivalent to fail() for server errors
        // Access status via response.status
        // Access content via responseBody
    })
 
    onFailure(({ error }) => {
        // Equivalent to fail() for network errors
    })
})
#Key differences
More granular error handling: The new system separates network failures (onFailure) from server errors (onError)
Better lifecycle hooks: Message interceptors provide additional hooks like onSync, onMorph, and onRender
Cancellation support: Both messages and requests can be cancelled/aborted
Component scoping: Message interceptors can be scoped to specific components using $wire.intercept(...)
For complete documentation on the new interceptor system, see the JavaScript Interceptors documentation.

#Upgrading Volt
Livewire v4 now supports single-file components, which use the same syntax as Volt class-based components. This means you can migrate from Volt to Livewire's built-in single-file components.

#Update component imports
Replace all instances of Livewire\Volt\Component with Livewire\Component:

// Before (Volt)
use Livewire\Volt\Component;
 
new class extends Component { ... }
 
// After (Livewire v4)
use Livewire\Component;
 
new class extends Component { ... }
#Update route definitions
Replace Volt::route() with Route::livewire() in your routes files:

// Before (Volt)
use Livewire\Volt\Volt;
 
Volt::route('/dashboard', 'dashboard');
 
// After (Livewire v4)
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;
 
Route::livewire('/dashboard', 'dashboard');
#Update test files
Replace all instances of Livewire\Volt\Volt with Livewire\Livewire and change Volt::test() to Livewire::test():

// Before (Volt)
use Livewire\Volt\Volt;
 
Volt::test('counter')
 
// After (Livewire v4)
use Livewire\Livewire;
 
Livewire::test('counter')
#Remove Volt service provider
Delete the Volt service provider file:

rm app/Providers/VoltServiceProvider.php
Then remove it from the providers array in bootstrap/providers.php:

// Before
return [
    App\Providers\AppServiceProvider::class,
    App\Providers\VoltServiceProvider::class,
];
 
// After
return [
    App\Providers\AppServiceProvider::class,
];
#Remove Volt package
Uninstall the Volt package:

composer remove livewire/volt
#Install Livewire v4
After completing the above changes, install Livewire v4. Your existing Volt class-based components will work without modification since they use the same syntax as Livewire's single-file components.

#New features in v4
Livewire v4 introduces several powerful new features you can start using immediately:

#Component features
Single-file and multi-file components

v4 introduces new component formats alongside the traditional class-based approach. Single-file components combine PHP and Blade in one file, while multi-file components organize PHP, Blade, JavaScript, and tests in a directory.

By default, view-based component files are prefixed with a ⚡ emoji to distinguish them from regular Blade files in your editor and searches. This can be disabled via the make_command.emoji config.

php artisan make:livewire create-post        # Single-file (default)
php artisan make:livewire create-post --mfc  # Multi-file
php artisan livewire:convert create-post     # Convert between formats

Slots and attribute forwarding

Components now support slots and automatic attribute bag forwarding using {{ $attributes }}, making component composition more flexible.

JavaScript in view-based components

View-based components can now include <script> tags without the @script wrapper. These scripts are served as separate cached files for better performance and automatic $wire binding:

<div>
    <!-- Your component template -->
</div>
 
<script>
    // $wire is automatically bound as 'this'
    this.count++  // Same as $wire.count++
 
    // $wire is still available if preferred
    $wire.save()
</script>

#Islands
Islands allow you to create isolated regions within a component that update independently, dramatically improving performance without creating separate child components.

@island(name: 'stats', lazy: true)
    <div>{{ $this->expensiveStats }}</div>
@endisland

#Loading improvements
Deferred loading

In addition to lazy loading (viewport-based), components can now be deferred to load immediately after the initial page load:

<livewire:revenue defer />
#[Defer]
class Revenue extends Component { ... }
Bundled loading

Control whether multiple lazy/deferred components load in parallel or bundled together:

<livewire:revenue lazy.bundle />
<livewire:expenses defer.bundle />
#[Lazy(bundle: true)]
class Revenue extends Component { ... }
Learn more about lazy and deferred loading →

#Async actions
Run actions in parallel without blocking other requests using the .async modifier or #[Async] attribute:

<button wire:click.async="logActivity">Track</button>
#[Async]
public function logActivity() { ... }
Learn more about async actions →

#New directives and modifiers
wire:sort - Drag-and-drop sorting

Built-in support for sortable lists with drag-and-drop:

<ul wire:sort="updateOrder">
    @foreach ($items as $item)
        <li wire:sort:item="{{ $item->id }}" wire:key="{{ $item->id }}">{{ $item->name }}</li>
    @endforeach
</ul>
Learn more about wire:sort →

wire:intersect - Viewport intersection

Run actions when elements enter or leave the viewport, similar to Alpine's x-intersect:

<!-- Basic usage -->
<div wire:intersect="loadMore">...</div>
 
<!-- With modifiers -->
<div wire:intersect.once="trackView">...</div>
<div wire:intersect:leave="pauseVideo">...</div>
<div wire:intersect.half="loadMore">...</div>
<div wire:intersect.full="startAnimation">...</div>
 
<!-- With options -->
<div wire:intersect.margin.200px="loadMore">...</div>
<div wire:intersect.threshold.50="trackScroll">...</div>
Available modifiers:

.once - Fire only once
.half - Wait until half is visible
.full - Wait until fully visible
.threshold.X - Custom visibility percentage (0-100)
.margin.Xpx or .margin.X% - Intersection margin

wire:ref - Element references

Easily reference and interact with elements in your template:

<div wire:ref="modal">
    <!-- Modal content -->
</div>
 
<button wire:click="$js.scrollToModal">Scroll to modal</button>
 
<script>
    this.$js.scrollToModal = () => {
        this.$refs.modal.scrollIntoView()
    }
</script>
Learn more about wire:ref →

.renderless modifier

Skip component re-rendering directly from the template:

<button wire:click.renderless="trackClick">Track</button>
This is an alternative to the #[Renderless] attribute for actions that don't need to update the UI.

.preserve-scroll modifier

Preserve scroll position during updates to prevent layout jumps:

<button wire:click.preserve-scroll="loadMore">Load More</button>
data-loading attribute

Every element that triggers a network request automatically receives a data-loading attribute, making it easy to style loading states with Tailwind:

<button wire:click="save" class="data-loading:opacity-50 data-loading:pointer-events-none">
    Save Changes
</button>
Learn more about loading states →

#JavaScript improvements
$errors magic property

Access your component's error bag from JavaScript:

<div wire:show="$errors.has('email')">
    <span wire:text="$errors.first('email')"></span>
</div>
Learn more about validation →

$intercept magic

Intercept and modify Livewire requests from JavaScript:

<script>
this.$intercept('save', ({ ... }) => {
    // ...
})
</script>

Island targeting from JavaScript

Trigger island renders directly from the template:

<button wire:click="loadMore" wire:island.append="stats">
    Load more
</button>
