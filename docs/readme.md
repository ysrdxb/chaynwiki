Summary:
We are making a competitor to the websites listed below
Design, layout must be COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. DO NOT COPY COMPETITORS. WE NEED TO MAKE A BETTER VERSION.
The core functionality / purpose of the site must remain the same. Everything else must change. 

Project purpose / Aim
The aim of this project is to develop a fully functional website where users can submit music related wiki-style articles. Basically imagine wikipedia, but for music. 
Here are some sites to give you an idea of what i mean:

Wikipedia 
reddit.com 
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Azzaro/The-Most-Wanted-66826.html 
https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page 
Design Foundation
https://www.figma.com/design/AlyvuUxdKgC4TmLJiy7Vle/SOUNDBOOK?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=RfWPstgXVY4egGrC-0
Please use this design as a foundation. Do not copy it exactly. But improve it where needed. 
Important requirement:
You have full creative control over this project. Treat it like your own. Build / remove features. Focus on user experience and ensure the user is able to do what they want to do as easily as possible.

Make sure to change / optimize the design AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE to make it as optimal for user experience.

To clarify, I am looking for a partner who can guide me on this project, not me guide them (you). This is important.

Since it's a big complex project, the dev responsible for this must have a true creative vision for this site and understand what the user really wants.
I really need someone who can take full control and manage this without me long term.


Fundamental core functionality
The following functionality is fundamental. The platform you build must be built around this core concept:
A wiki platform where users can share topics about music. Similar to wikipedia
A homepage where people can view music related topics that other users submit. 


1 - This site will be dedicated to music trends only: popular genres, songs, artists, playlists and miscellaneous terminology. 

2 - include important fields for each category of content. 
Example for each genre item: who created the genre, popu;ar artists etc…Orginal release date….
For a song: Lyrics, release date, artist, genre it falls under, stream count updating in real time (or the user can just provide the link to sidechayn and automatically pre-fill info). 

3  - Rank items on the homepage based on views / SEO ranking and trending now. 

4 - Make it clear on the homepage, write a copy that explains we are not affiliated with soundcloud. 

5 - Use this as inspiration
